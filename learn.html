            </p>
            <p>Let's take a look at the board.</p>
            <div class="about-board">
                <p>The board contains 8 rows and 8 columns, rows are called as ranks and columns are called as files.
                    There are 64 four squares in total.</p>

            </div>
            <p> 
                From above image you can see that there are 6 distinct pieces in chess.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First we have the pawn there are total 8 pawns for each player so total of 16 pawn on the board</li>
                <li>The rook - Its an important piece which has 5 points and there 2 rooks for each player.</li>
                <li>The bishop - Its also a powerful piece and has 3 points, each player has 2 bishops on dark squared
                    and light sqauared</li>
                <li>The knight (horsey) - This piece comes with an advantage to jump over other pieces we will see how
                    below there are 2 horses for each player each has 3 points</li>
                <li>The Queen - the most powerful piece with 9 points each player has one queen at the start</li>
                <li>The King - The piece on which the whole game is actually played</li>
            </ol>
           
            <div>
                <h2>Piece Movement</h2>
                <p>
                    Before starting to play, lets take a look on how each piece moves and the board.
                </p>
                <div class="learn-pawn">
                    <h2><img class="learn-img" src="./images/white-pawn.png" alt="">Pawn:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The pawns are the most basic and fundamental chessmen in the entire game.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It moves one step forward only, but if its the first move of pawn then, it can move
                            2 steps forward. It captures piece diagonally.
                        </li>
                        <img class="pawn-move-gif" src="images/pawn-moves-promotesgif.gif" alt="pawn-moves-gif">
                        <li>
                            The pawn has a special advantage over other piece i.e it can promote to either a
                            Queen, Rook, Bishop or a Knight when it reaches the opposite end of the board.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also there is one special move called En Passant that the pwan can do, where when
                            the pawn can capture opponent pawn which has its first move as 2 steps forward
                            provided that both the pawn are besides each other.</p>
                        </li>

                <div class="special-rules">
                    <h2>Special Moves</h2>
                    <p>While starting to play chess as a beginner, you might be caught off guard by weird moves that look too odd to be legal.But The are not illegal, lets see few special moves that you come across while playing chess.
                        <br>These rules in chess give you are greater advantage over your opponent.</p>
                    <h3>1. Castling</h3> 
                    <p>&emsp;Castling is the only move in chess that lets you move 2 pieces simultaneously the piece being the king and rook. 
                        When castling is allowed, you can move your king two squares to the side, grab the rook from the side you're castling to, and place it over and next to the king. 
                        Also you can only castle when there are on other pieces in between.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are 2 types of castle one is queen side castle(long) where you castle from the queen side and other the king side castle, where you caslte from king side.
                    <br>Below you can see how castling is actually done.</p> 
                    <!-- Add castling gif -->
                    <h3>2. Pawn Promotion</h3>
                    <p>Pawn Promotion is probably the special move that most beginners should know that it exist, although there's usually some confusion as to how it truly works.
                         This rule allows a pawn to become any piece (other than a king or staying a pawn) 
                         when it gets to the farthest rank from where it started (eighth for White and first for Black).
                    </p>
                    <!-- add pawn promotion gif -->
                    <h3>3. En Passant</h3>
                    <p>Beginners are usually startled when they first see an en passant capture—especially when it happens against them.
                         This rule allows pawns on the fifth rank for White and fourth rank for Black to capture another pawn that has just "passed it" in a single move.
                        It's the only capture in chess where the capturing piece doesn't land on the same square as the piece it's capturing.</p>
                    <p>watch below carefully how en passant is actually done.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="openings">
                    <h2>Openings</h2>
                    <p>Now that we are familiar with the pieces we can learn how we should open our game, game openings gives you a good advantage over your opponent,it would help you develop your pieces efficiently</p>
                    <p>Also it is totally okay as a beginner if you don't memorize openings moves but you should be familiar with opening principles few of which is controlling the center and developing pieces</p>
                </div>
                <div class="middle-game">
                    <h2>The Middle Game</h2>
                    <p>The middlegame is the portion of a chess game between the opening and the endgame. It is generally considered to begin when each player has completed the development of all or most of their pieces and brought their king to relative safety, and it is generally considered to end when only a few pieces remain on the board. However, there is no clear line between the opening and middlegame or between the middlegame and endgame.</p>
